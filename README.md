# Weather app :cloud:

## About

A weather application built using React as part of the [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com) Front end module. 

## Description
The aim of this project is to understand:
- React
- JSX
- Props
- Props validation
- State
- Stateful components
- Stateless (presentational) components
- React Hooks
- React Testing Library
- Request/Response
- Error Handling

## Features

Users can search for the weather in a given location, if the location doesn't exist an error will be thrown. The user can also acquire more details about the weather on specific days by clicking the 'More details'.

## Getting started 

- Clone this repo
  * e.g. `git clone git@github.com:EmilyRoseCotter/weather-app.git`
- Change directory into the repo
  * e.g. `cd weather-app` (or the directory you specified the repo to be cloned into)
- Install the dependencies from `package-lock.json`
  * `npm install`
- To start the app:
  * `npm start`
- To test the app:
  * `npm test`

## Testing 

This app was built using the BDD approach. The components were built first followed by the tests. 

All tests can be found inside of the `./src/tests` directory.

Users can run the tests for themselves, by running `npm install` to install the dependencies, followed by `npm test` to run the tests.

## Styling
The styling of this app is still a work in progress
